# Universal Runtime Guard — Development Roadmap

This document tracks the **current development phase** and every planned
future phase for the project.  It is updated as features ship or priorities
change.

> **Architecture:** This project follows a **Rust-core, polyglot-wrapper**
> pattern — a single Rust engine with thin, idiomatic wrappers for Python,
> Node.js, Go, and more.  Python is the "front door" for early adoption;
> Rust is the "engine room" for performance and cross-platform reach.
> See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design document.

## Phase 3 — Production Hardening & Rust Core 🔄 (current)

**Goal:** Harden the Python implementation for production use (thread safety,
input validation, defensive error handling, observability), scaffold the Rust
core engine, and set up contributor infrastructure.

> This follows the **Rust-core, polyglot-wrapper** architecture described in
> [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).  The Python Phase 1 implementation
> serves as the prototype and specification; every test becomes a contract
> that the Rust core must satisfy.

### Remaining items

- [ ] **Python PyO3 binding**
  Replace the pure-Python internals with calls to the compiled `guard-core`
  library via PyO3.  The public Python API (`guard.activate()`) stays
  identical — existing users see no change.

- [ ] **Node.js wrapper** (`npm install universal-runtime-guard`)
  A thin JS shim (via napi-rs) that hooks `process.on('uncaughtException')`
  and patches `node-fetch` / `axios`.

- [ ] **Go module**
  A `guard.Activate()` call that wraps `net/http.DefaultClient` and
  intercepts `panic` via `recover()`.

- [ ] **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/guard-audit.yml`)
  A reusable workflow that runs `guard audit` as a PR check.

---

## Phase 4 — Live Advisory DB & Supply-Chain Tooling 🔭

**Goal:** Keep the vulnerability database current without requiring a package
upgrade, and support supply-chain compliance workflows.

### Planned items

- [ ] **Live OSV / PyPA Advisory DB integration**
  Optional `live=True` flag on `run_all_scans()` that fetches advisories
  from `https://osv.dev/query` and merges them with the built-in DB.
  Falls back to built-in DB when offline.

- [ ] **Advisory database caching**
  Cache live-fetched advisories to `~/.cache/guard/advisories.json` with a
  configurable TTL so repeated scans don't incur network overhead.

- [ ] **CycloneDX / SPDX SBOM export**
  `guard sbom --format cyclonedx > sbom.json` generates a Software Bill of
  Materials from the current environment, suitable for submission to
  customers or regulators.

- [ ] **Dependency graph conflict detection**
  Use `pip`'s resolver internals to surface version-conflict trees, not
  just individual package advisories.

- [ ] **Licence compliance scanning**
  Warn when installed packages use licences incompatible with a configurable
  allow-list (e.g., GPL in a proprietary project).

---

## Phase 5 — Dashboard, Alerting & LLM Suggestions 🔭

**Goal:** Provide operational visibility and leverage LLMs for richer
fix suggestions.

### Planned items

- [ ] **`guard serve` dashboard sidecar**
  A lightweight HTTP server (`uvicorn`) that exposes:
  - A Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint with error counts and dependency health.
  - A web UI (`/ui`) showing live events, suppressed crashes, and
    vulnerability alerts — zero changes to application code required.

- [ ] **Alert webhooks**
  Configurable webhook POST to Slack, PagerDuty, or a custom URL when
  a new vulnerability is detected or error counts exceed a threshold.

- [ ] **Remote error reporting**
  Opt-in batched POST of error events to a configurable endpoint
  (Sentry-compatible DSN or the guard cloud service), enabling
  cross-instance error correlation.

- [ ] **LLM-powered fix suggestions**
  For errors that match no static pattern in `guard/advisor.py`, optionally
  call a locally-running or remote LLM (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic — opt-in,
  never on by default) to generate a free-form suggestion.  The public
  interface remains identical: callers always get a plain string or `None`.

- [ ] **Historical trend analysis**
  Persist error counts to SQLite and expose a `guard report` command that
  shows error frequency trends over the last N days.

- [ ] **AI-workflow integration**
  Attach guard suggestions to the IDE diagnostic channel so AI assistants
  (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) can auto-fix flagged errors.  Generate a
  `.guard` context file for AI agents and expose guard as a Model Context
  Protocol (MCP) tool server.
